/* Component-specific styles are now primarily handled via MUI's sx prop or the styled() utility. */
/* Global layout aspects are managed by MUI components like Container, AppBar, Grid, Box. */
/* This file is intentionally left mostly empty. */

/*
  The .App class with text-align: center is no longer needed as content alignment
  should be handled by specific MUI layout components (e.g., Box, Container with textAlign prop).
*/

/*
  All navigation (nav, ul, li, a), container, table, button, and message area styles
  have been superseded by their respective MUI component implementations and styling.
*/

/*
  If there are any truly global styles that *cannot* be achieved through MUI's
  theming or component styling, they could theoretically reside here, but it's
  generally preferred to use MUI's styling solutions for consistency.
